<ol type="1">
<li>Minimize amount of personnel needing to use respiratory protection (engineering and administrative controls)</li>
<li>Use alternatives to N95 respirators (e.g., other classes of filtering facepiece respirators, elastomeric half-mask and full facepiece air purifying respirators, powered air purifying respirators)</li>
<li>Allow extended use or limited reuse of respirators (e.g. reuse for pathogens in which contact transmission is not a concern)
<ol type="a">
<li>Clarify doffing and donning protocols for equipment to solely be in use when in contact with patients</li>
</ol></li>
<li>Prioritize the use of N95 respirators for those personnel at the highest risk of contracting or experiencing complications of infection</li>

<blockquote>
<p>ECRI supports prioritizing extend use over reuse because: - The reported pathogen transfer risk from N95s is high by contact (donning and doffing) but low by aerosol (spread by breathing through a used mask). - Use of surgical masks or similar disposable covers over N95s during extended use are unlikely to result in significant adverse effects. - Mechanical failure (e.g., broken straps and poor sealing between the mask and the user’s face) with only a few reuses was common across FDA-cleared (i.e., for medical use) N95s.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The University of Nebraska Medical Center has developed a protocol now being referenced by multiple sources: <a href="https://www.nebraskamed.com/sites/default/files/documents/covid-19/n-95-decon-process.pdf" class="uri">https://www.nebraskamed.com/sites/default/files/documents/covid-19/n-95-decon-process.pdf</a>. This protocol is for surface decontamination and reuse of N95 respirators building upon CDC recommendations <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/hcp/ppe-strategy/decontamination-reuse-respirators.html" class="uri">https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/hcp/ppe-strategy/decontamination-reuse-respirators.html</a> which suggest that: Disposable filtering facepiece respirators (FFRs) are not approved for routine decontamination and reuse as standard of care. However, FFR decontamination and reuse may need to be considered as a crisis capacity strategy to ensure continued availability. Based on the limited research available, ultraviolet germicidal irradiation, vaporous hydrogen peroxide, and moist heat showed the most promise as potential methods to decontaminate FFRs.</p>

<p>As of 4/4/20 Public Health Ontario has synthesized literature on the topic which supports the guidance provided above: <a href="https://www.publichealthontario.ca/-/media/documents/ncov/covid-wwksf/what-we-know-reuse-of-personal-protective-equipment.pdf?la=en" class="uri">https://www.publichealthontario.ca/-/media/documents/ncov/covid-wwksf/what-we-know-reuse-of-personal-protective-equipment.pdf?la=en</a> There is no clear scientific consensus regarding the use or reuse of equipment and PHO defers to American sources (primarily NIOSH and CDC). UV radiation is the most suggested potential form of decontamination, and the Nebraska protocol of UVGI at 60mJ/cm^2. Two 254nm UV lamps are directed towards wire hanging masks in a UV chamber for approximately 5 minutes per cycle.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>The above‐named organizations advise clinicians that sharing mechanical ventilators should not be attempted because it cannot be done safely with current equipment.</strong> Attempting to ventilate multiple patients with COVID‐19, given the issues described here, could lead to poor outcomes and high mortality rates for all patients cohorted. It is better to purpose the ventilator to the patient most likely to benefit than fail to prevent, or even cause, the demise of multiple patients.</p>

<ol type="1">
<li>Identify medications requiring smart pumps.</li>
<li>Take inventory of all available pumps.</li>
<li>IV to oral (or IM) conversion. Organizations should switch patients from IV to oral therapies as soon as possible.</li>
<li>Use IV push instead of infusions.</li>
<li>Administration set change policy. Another item that should be reviewed is the hospital’s current administration set change policy.</li>
<li>Potential role for gravity infusions.</li>
<li>Subcutaneous infusions. Subcutaneous gravity infusions may be an option for parenteral delivery of medications and solutions for some patients.</li>
